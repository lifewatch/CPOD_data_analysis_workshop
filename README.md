# CPOD_data_analysis_workshop

On October 5 and 6 2017, the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) organized a data analysis workshop to learn and discuss about the LifeWatch network for harbour porpoise detection. The data and scripts used and developed during this workshop are available through the LifeWatch github.
Lifewatch needs to be cited if these data are used.
